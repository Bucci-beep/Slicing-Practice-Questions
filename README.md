This repository contains a series of Python practice questions that focus on list slicing, array manipulation, and other fundamental tasks in Python programming. Each file provides a solution to a specific slicing-related problem.

## Files and Descriptions

- **accessing_specific_elements.py**: Demonstrates how to access specific elements in a list using slicing techniques.
- **array_reversal.py**: Contains code to reverse an array using Python slicing.
- **extracting_columns.py**: Demonstrates how to extract columns from a 2D list (matrix).
- **reversing_rows_and_columns.py**: A solution for reversing both rows and columns in a 2D list.
- **row_extraction.py**: Extracts a specific row from a 2D list.
- **slicing_subarrays.py**: Shows how to slice subarrays from larger arrays.
